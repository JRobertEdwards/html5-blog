# HTML5-Up website

This is a small website that I've made using a <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5up</a> template and the Laravel framework.

# How to setup

Once you've git cloned you should be able to run the following commands to setup once you've entered db credentials:

`composer install`

`php artisan migrate`

`php artisan serve`
